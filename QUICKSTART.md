# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## You're Almost Done! Just 3 Steps:

### Step 1: Add Your Profile Picture
1. Find a good photo of yourself (or use the placeholder generator)
2. Save it as `images/profile.jpg`
3. Recommended size: 400x400px

**Quick Option:** Open `image-generator.html` in your browser to create a placeholder!

### Step 2: Update Your Information

#### Edit `index.html`:
- Line 6: Update the page title
- Line 7: Update meta description
- Lines 54-56: Your name and bio
- Lines 60-74: Your social media links

#### Edit `js/main.js`:

- Lines 77-122: Your skills  
- Lines 124-150: Your platforms/channels

### Step 3: Open and Test!

**Option A - Direct:**
```
Just double-click index.html
```

**Option B - Local Server (Better):**
```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js  
npx http-server

# PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:8000`
